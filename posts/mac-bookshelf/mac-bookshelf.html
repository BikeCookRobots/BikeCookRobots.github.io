The Apple Power Mac G5 incidentally makes a very good bookshelf. Originally, I wanted to use it as a PC case and put standard ATX components in there. However, when I garbage picked this, I was in college and dint have nearly the skills I have now to mod it [1](javascript:; "which doesn't say much"). I instead decided to turn it into a bookshelf with a string of white LEDs outlining the inside of it. Originally, it was controlled with a switch in line with the DC input. Back then, though, I imagined how cool it would be if the power button controlled the state of the lights.

Recently I accomplished that. The circuit shown bellow was borrowed from a video i saw about using the 555 chip in interesting ways. With the flip flop circuit i was able to toggle the signal going to the base of a transistor and thus toggle the state of the lights.
